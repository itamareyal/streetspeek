# Streetspeek

Streetspeek is an AI-based city guide designed to help people navigate through the city with ease. This project can identify text from various sources such as street signs, banners, and train station signs. Once identified, it uses location-based language detection to determine the language of the text, allowing it to accurately translate and convert the text into the desired language. 

Moreover, Streetspeek can extract the object containing the text, whether it's a street sign, a train, a bus, or a menu, and add relevant information from open source websites. For example, if the text is on a bus stop, Streetspeek will provide the bus stop information and schedules.
